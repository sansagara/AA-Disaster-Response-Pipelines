# Disaster Response AA Pipeline
This is a simple Advanced Analytics project to automatically classify emergency messages on social media.
The idea is simple: Given a short message, detect if it is related to a particular emergency ðŸš¨ 

## Overview
In this project, we use Data/ML Engineering to process real disaster messages provided by [FigureEight to build a ML model so an API can classify disaster messages](https://www.vertosoft.com/figureeight).

Here, I've created a Data/ML pipeline to categorize these events so that any meesage gets categorized as an emergency and possibly routed to the appropriate Emergency Response Agency.

The project includes a Flask web app where an emergency worker can input a new messages and get classification results on several categories. The web app will also display some visualizations of the data.

## Project 
### Components 
There are three components on this project:

- ETL Pipeline
- ML Pipeline
- Visualization App

### Content
- Data
  - process_data.py: reads the data, cleans and stores it in a SQLite database. 
    usage: python process_data.py MESSAGES_DATA CATEGORIES_DATA NAME_FOR_DATABASE`
  - disaster_categories.csv  dataset provided by Figure Eight
  - disaster_messages.csv dataset provided by Figure Eight
  - DisasterResponse.db: created database from transformed and cleaned data.
- Models
  - train_classifier.py: includes the code necessary to load data, transform it with NLP, run a machine learning model using GridSearchCV and train it.
    usage: `python train_classifier.py DATABASE_DIRECTORY SAVENAME_FOR_MODEL`
    >Note: This might take a while to run.
- App
  - run.py: Flask app and the user interface used to predict results and display them.
  - templates: folder containing the html templates

### Example:
> python process_data.py disaster_messages.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db
> python train_classifier.py ../data/DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl
> python run.py

### About
This project was prepared as part of the Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree programme. The data was provided by Figure Eight. 

### Instructions:

1. Run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in sqlite:
    `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`

2. Run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves:
    `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

3. Run the flask app:
    `python app/run.py`

4. Open http://0.0.0.0:3001/ on your browser.
